The plugin creates an image slideshow as a background to your website.

== Description ==

Full Screen Background Images Plugin inspired by the plugin (<a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/full-screen-background-images/">see original</a>) of <a href="http://www.kouratoras.gr">Konstantinos Kouratoras</a> (kouratoras). The plugin creates an image slideshow as a background to your website. I made structural changes for future development and addes some setting options. My intention is to add a widget you can put anywhere on your website, expend the options for background (showing the title, adding text) and lots more.
